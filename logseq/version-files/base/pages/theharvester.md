- TheHarvester is a free and open-source tool developed in Python that can be used for gathering information about emails, sub-domains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and banners from different public sources like search engines, PGP key servers, and SHODAN computer database. It is a command-line tool that acts as a wrapper for a variety of search engines and is used to find email accounts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports/banners, and employee names related to a domain from different public sources. TheHarvester is particularly useful during the reconnaissance phase of gathering Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). It is used by penetration testers, #networking and system administrators, and cybersecurity enthusiasts to find potential security threats in web applications. TheHarvester comes pre-installed in Kali Linux, and it can be installed using the command "sudo apt-get theharvester" if it is not already installed. Some of the options available in TheHarvester include domain to search or company name, data source, start in result number, verify hostname via DNS resolution, and search for virtual hosts. TheHarvester is a useful tool for information gathering and reconnaissance during penetration testing and security auditing.
