	- Make sure you are superuser
	- If you're still encountering the same issue even after activating the "testing" builder, it's possible that there might be a configuration problem or an issue with Docker Buildx on your system. Here are a few additional steps you can try to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:
	- 1. Restart Docker: Sometimes, restarting the Docker daemon can help resolve various configuration issues. You can do this with the following command:
	- ```bash
	  sudo systemctl restart docker
	  ```
	- 2. Check Docker Buildx Version: Make sure you're using a compatible version of Docker and Docker Buildx. It's possible that there could be compatibility issues with older versions. Update Docker and Docker Buildx to the latest versions if you're not already using them.
	- 3. Re-create the Builder: If you've tried all the above steps and are still facing issues, you can try re-creating the builder from scratch. Remove the existing builder and create a new one with the necessary parameters.
	- First, remove the existing "testing" builder:
	- ```bash
	   docker buildx rm testing
	   ```
	- Then, create a new builder:
	- ```bash
	   docker buildx create --use --name testing --driver docker-container --driver-opt network=kasm_default_network
	   ```
	- Activate the new builder:
	- ```bash
	   docker buildx use testing
	   ```
	- Finally, try building your Docker image again:
	- ```bash
	   docker buildx build --builder testing -t kali-custom:beta .
	   ```
	- 4. Debugging: If the problem persists, you may need to gather more information about the issue. You can try running the build with debugging enabled to get more detailed error messages:
	- ```bash
	   BUILDKIT_DEBUG=1 docker buildx build --builder testing -t kali-custom:beta . 2> build.log
	   ```
	- Check the "build.log" file for any specific error messages or issues that may help diagnose the problem.
	- If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide more details about your environment, including your Docker and Docker Buildx versions, and any specific error messages or logs, so that I can assist you further.
	- docker buildx build --builder testing -t kali-custom:beta --load .
	- docker push ayaan7345/hackbox:v0.0.4
