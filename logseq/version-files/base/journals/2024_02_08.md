	- Sure, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the Zero Trust Framework. Please go ahead and ask your questions.
	- 1. What is Zero Trust Framework in network security?
	  
	  Zero Trust Framework is an approach to network security that assumes no trust in any user or device, regardless of their location or network environment. It focuses on continuous verification and strict access control to protect critical resources from potential threats. The framework requires verification and authorization for every user, device, or application attempting to access network resources.
	  
	  2. How does the Zero Trust Framework differ from traditional security models?
	  
	  The traditional security models are often based on perimeter-based approaches, where trust is primarily established based on the user's location or network perimeter. In contrast, the Zero Trust Framework adopts a model that assumes no implicit trust and verifies every access request explicitly, regardless of location. It emphasizes identity-based access control and continuous user verification rather than relying solely on network perimeters.
	  
	  3. What are the core principles of the Zero Trust Framework?
	  
	  The core principles of the Zero Trust Framework include:
	  
	  a. Authentication: Users and devices must be verified and authenticated before granting access to resources.
	  
	  b. Least Privilege: Users and devices should be granted only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.
	  
	  c. Micro-segmentation: Network resources should be divided into smaller segments, limiting access based on the concept of least privilege.
	  
	  d. Continuous Monitoring: Network traffic, user behavior, and access logs should be continuously monitored to identify any anomalies or suspicious activities.
	  
	  e. Zero Trust Architecture: The entire network infrastructure should be designed with a Zero Trust mindset, with security controls embedded throughout the network.
	  
	  4. What are the benefits of implementing the Zero Trust Framework?
	  
	  The benefits of implementing the Zero Trust Framework include:
	  
	  a. Enhanced Security: By eliminating the trust assumption and continuously verifying access requests, the Zero Trust Framework mitigates the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and lateral movement of threats within the network.
	  
	  b. Improved Visibility: The framework emphasizes continuous monitoring, providing organizations with more visibility into network traffic and user activities, enabling better threat detection and incident response.
	  
	  c. Flexibility: Zero Trust Framework allows users to access resources from various locations and devices securely, without being limited by a trusted network perimeter.
	  
	  d. Scalability: The framework can accommodate distributed systems, cloud environments, and various types of devices, offering scalability and adaptability to modern IT infrastructures.
	  
	  e. Compliance: Implementing a Zero Trust approach can help organizations achieve compliance with various regulatory frameworks by ensuring better access control and data protection.
	  
	  5. What are the challenges associated with implementing the Zero Trust Framework?
	  
	  Some challenges associated with implementing the Zero Trust Framework include:
	  
	  a. Complexity: Designing and implementing a Zero Trust architecture can be complex, as it often requires significant changes to existing network infrastructure and security controls.
	  
	  b. User Experience: If not implemented carefully, continuous user verification and multi-factor authentication can potentially impact user experience, resulting in frustration and resistance.
	  
	  c. Legacy Systems: Integrating legacy systems that were not originally designed with a Zero Trust mindset can be challenging and may require additional effort and resources.
	  
	  d. Adoption and Cultural Change: Implementing a Zero Trust approach requires a cultural shift within the organization, as it might disrupt familiar workflows and challenge established security practices.
	  
	  Despite these challenges, the benefits of implementing a Zero Trust Framework outweigh the difficulties, as it provides a robust and adaptive security posture in modern network environments.

- This professor is smart all the projects that he showed were for DOD projects and the one im perfecting at the moment is Zero trust Framework. This isn't new but its hard to implement and there are many security compliance issues that create headaches. Im assuming that he has a security clearance. The Zero trust Architecture was recently mandated by the government and this is why they came out with a new CMMC compliance for the new gen MSP's to implement them. I think he really likes drones. Talks about current security frame works like the Miter attack frame work. Kind of froze durring question's i asked the difference between the miter attack framework and the zero trust he just was able to repeat the slides.Has good eye contact he did this weird thing with his tamber that was able to attach my attention to the lecture. I like the animations that were on the screen looks like he took the time to make the presentation.
