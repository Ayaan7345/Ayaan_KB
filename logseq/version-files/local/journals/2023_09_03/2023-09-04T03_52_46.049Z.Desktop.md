- How to background shell in metasploit
	- To background a shell in Metasploit, you can use the `background` command. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:
	  
	  1. Start by launching Metasploit. Open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:
	     ```
	     msfconsole
	     ```
	  
	  2. Once Metasploit loads, use the `exploit` command to select and execute an exploit module. For example, if you want to exploit a vulnerable FTP server, you can use the `exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor` module. Type the following command:
	     ```
	     use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
	     ```
	  
	  3. Set the required options for the exploit module. You may need to provide values for options like `RHOST` (target IP address), `RPORT` (target port), or others. Use the `show options` command to view and set the required options. For example:
	     ```
	     set RHOST <target_ip>
	     ```
	  
	  4. Once you have set the required options, run the `exploit` command to launch the exploit against the target:
	     ```
	     exploit
	     ```
	  
	  5. If the exploit is successful and you gain a shell access, you can use the `sessions` command to list active sessions. Identify the session number of the shell you want to background.
	  
	  6. Now, to background the shell and return to the Metasploit console, use the `background` command followed by the session number. For example, if the session number is 1, enter:
	     ```
	     background 1
	     ```
	  
	  7. The shell will be successfully backgrounded, and you will return to the Metasploit console, allowing you to continue using other exploits or modules.
	  
	  Remember to keep an eye on your backgrounded sessions with the `sessions` command in case you need to switch back to a specific session later.
