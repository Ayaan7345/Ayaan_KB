		- Dig is a command-line tool used for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain information about domain names, IP addresses, and other DNS records. It is a useful tool for #networking troubleshooting and educational purposes[3]. Here are some of the most commonly used Dig commands:
		- 1. To perform a basic DNS lookup for a domain name:
		- `dig example.com`
		- 2. To perform a DNS lookup for a specific record type, such as an A record:
		- ```dig example.com A```
		- 3. To perform a DNS lookup for a specific DNS server:
		- ```dig example.com @ns1.example.com```
		- 4. To perform a reverse DNS lookup to obtain the domain name associated with an IP address:
		- ```dig -x 192.0.2.1```
		- 5. To perform a DNS lookup with a specific DNS server and record type:
		- ```dig example.com MX @ns1.example.com```
		- 6. To perform a DNS lookup with a specific DNS server and port number:
		- ```dig example.com @ns1.example.com -p 5353```
		- 7. To perform a DNS lookup with a specific DNS server and query type:
		- ```dig example.com -t NS @ns1.example.com```
		- 8. To perform a DNS lookup with a specific DNS server and query class:
		- ```dig example.com -c CHAOS @ns1.example.com```
		- 9. To perform a DNS lookup with a specific DNS server and EDNS0 options:
		- ```dig example.com @ns1.example.com +dnssec +bufsize=4096```
		- 10. To perform a DNS lookup with a specific DNS server and #tcp protocol:
		- ```dig example.com @ns1.example.com +#tcp```
		- There are many other options and flags that can be used with Dig, and it is a powerful tool for DNS enumeration and reconnaissance[2][5].
