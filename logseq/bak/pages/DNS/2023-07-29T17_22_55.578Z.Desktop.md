- DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, and other resources in the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) #networkings. DNS is like a phonebook for the Internet that translates human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into machine-readable IP addresses, such as 192.0.2.44[1][3][4][6]. DNS is a naming database that maps the name people use to locate a website to the IP address that a computer uses to locate that website. DNS mapping is distributed throughout the internet in a hierarchy of authority. Access providers and enterprises, as well as governments, universities, and other organizations, typically have their own assigned ranges of IP addresses and an assigned domain name. They also typically run DNS servers to manage the mapping of those names to those addresses[1]. DNS is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure and is used for web browsing and most other internet activities to quickly provide the information necessary to connect users to remote hosts[1][3]. DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses, controlling which server an end-user will reach when they type a domain name into their web browser[6]. DNS is a distributed and fault-tolerant system that has helped avoid the need for a single central register to be continually consulted and updated[5].
