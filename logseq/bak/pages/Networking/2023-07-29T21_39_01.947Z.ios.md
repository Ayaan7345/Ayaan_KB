- What is #Subnetting
	- [Subnet-Guide.xlsx](../assets/Subnet-Guide_1688245129991_0.xlsx)
	- 1. Create a new subnet:
	  
	  To create a new subnet, you will need to determine the number of hosts you will need in the subnet. Then, using the subnet mask formula, calculate the network address of the subnet, and the broadcast address of the subnet.
	  
	  2. Determine size of subnet:
	  
	  To determine the size of the subnet, you need to subtract the number of addresses in the first subnet (the network address) from the number of addresses in the second subnet (the broadcast address).
	  
	  3. Calculate subnet mask:
	  
	  To calculate the subnet mask for a network, begin by counting the number of bits that need to be used for subnetting (this will depend on the number of hosts you need). Find the next closest power of two and use that number as the number of octets for the subnet mask. For example, if you need 8 hosts, you would need three octets (110 is 8) and would use a subnet mask of 255.255.248.0.
	  
	  4. Split an existing subnet:
	  
	  To split an existing subnet, you will first need to determine the number of hosts you need in each subnet. Then, take the current subnet’s network address and use that as the starting point for the first subnet. For the second subnet, take the previous subnet’s broadcast address and use that as the starting point. Finally, calculate the new subnet masks as described above.
	- Subnetting is a network addressing technique used to divide a larger network into smaller, more efficient subnetworks or subnets. This enables network administrators to break down a large network into smaller, more manageable sections. Subnetting helps save network traffic by reducing broadcast domains, and improves network security by isolating traffic from different departments or users of a network. It also simplifies the task of network traffic management and routing by making it easier to identify which machines are related and which networks should be used for specific traffic.
