- Write a indepth summary of what ###networkinginging does and how it relates to cyber security and include examples
	- ###networkinginging enables the connection and transmission of data between multiple different devices, typically so that these devices can communicate in order to share information or resources. This can include physical connections or wireless ###networkingings. ###networkinginging plays an essential role in many aspects of computing, including online activities, streaming and downloading audio and video, gaming, and data storage and retrieval. In the cyber security arena, ###networkinginging is a critical component of cyber security solutions. ###networkinging security is the collective set of measures used to protect a computer ###networkinging and its associated resources from unauthorized access, destruction, alteration, or misuse. ###networkinging security controls include the enforcement of security policies, implementation of encryption protocols, the use of security scanning techniques, and the deployment of firewalls. For example, a firewall can be used to block malicious payloads from entering a computing system by blocking malicious traffic at the ###networkinging layer. Other common ###networkinging security measures include the use of anti-malware and anti-virus programs, two-factor authentication, and use of Virtual Private ###networkingings (VPNs) for secure access to remote systems. These practices have become increasingly critical in defending against cyber-attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which can overwhelm a system with malicious requests. Together, these measures provide essential protection against cyber threats, allowing organizations to remain secure and operational in a complex and ever-changing digital landscape.

- What is #Subnetting
	- [Subnet-Guide.xlsx](../assets/Subnet-Guide_1688245129991_0.xlsx)
	- 1. Create a new subnet:
	  
	  To create a new subnet, you will need to determine the number of hosts you will need in the subnet. Then, using the subnet mask formula, calculate the ###networkinging address of the subnet, and the broadcast address of the subnet.
	  
	  2. Determine size of subnet:
	  
	  To determine the size of the subnet, you need to subtract the number of addresses in the first subnet (the ###networkinging address) from the number of addresses in the second subnet (the broadcast address).
	  
	  3. Calculate subnet mask:
	  
	  To calculate the subnet mask for a ###networkinging, begin by counting the number of bits that need to be used for subnetting (this will depend on the number of hosts you need). Find the next closest power of two and use that number as the number of octets for the subnet mask. For example, if you need 8 hosts, you would need three octets (110 is 8) and would use a subnet mask of 255.255.248.0.
	  
	  4. Split an existing subnet:
	  
	  To split an existing subnet, you will first need to determine the number of hosts you need in each subnet. Then, take the current subnet’s ###networkinging address and use that as the starting point for the first subnet. For the second subnet, take the previous subnet’s broadcast address and use that as the starting point. Finally, calculate the new subnet masks as described above.
	- Subnetting is a ###networkinging addressing technique used to divide a larger ###networkinging into smaller, more efficient sub###networkingings or subnets. This enables ###networkinging administrators to break down a large ###networkinging into smaller, more manageable sections. Subnetting helps save ###networkinging traffic by reducing broadcast domains, and improves ###networkinging security by isolating traffic from different departments or users of a ###networkinging. It also simplifies the task of ###networkinging traffic management and routing by making it easier to identify which machines are related and which ###networkingings should be used for specific traffic.
