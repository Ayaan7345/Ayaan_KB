	- This layer helps with transfer of data between hosts and error recovery
	- It will also moderate the flow of informaiton
	- Session Multiplexing is when the host can support multiple session at a time. Like getting email and opening up a web browser at the same time
- #TCP
	- Transport Control Protocol
	- This is a layer 4 technology that is a **Connection oriented** transfer of data **syn>synack>ack** this is a 3 way handshake
	- This protocol sends data in the correct order and makes suer that all the data reaches the receiver
	- if you need reliability you will use TCP
	- TCP can also deal with flow control
	- there is more overhead
- #UDP
	- This another layer 4 protocol for sending traffic **best effort** this means there is no check sum on the 4th layer the application layer will deal with it if need be
	- This connection is **not connection oriented**
	- its not reliable but this is better for video watching
	- there is less overhead
