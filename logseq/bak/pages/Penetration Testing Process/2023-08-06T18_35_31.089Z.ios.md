- The main reason we do Pentetration testing is to manage or midigate risks to identify and evauluate secruity risks.

- Make sure to take these steps before a pentest to avoid violating laws
  | **Precautionary Measure** |
  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
  | `☐` | Obtain written consent from the owner or authorized representative of the computer or network being tested |
  | `☐` | Conduct the testing within the scope of the consent obtained only and respect any limitations specified |
  | `☐` | Take measures to prevent causing damage to the systems or networks being tested |
  | `☐` | Do not access, use or disclose personal data or any other information obtained during the testing without permission |
  | `☐` | Do not intercept electronic communications without the consent of one of the parties to the communication |
  | `☐` | Do not conduct testing on systems or networks that are covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) without proper authorization |
- A quick summary of the procedures for a pentest start to finish
- | **Stage** | **Description** |
  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
  | `1. Pre-Engagement` | The first step is to create all the necessary documents in the pre-engagement phase, discuss the assessment objectives, and clarify any questions. |
  | `2. Information Gathering` | Once the pre-engagement activities are complete, we investigate the company's existing website we have been assigned to assess. We identify the technologies in use and learn how the web application functions. |
  | `3. Vulnerability Assessment` | With this information, we can look for known vulnerabilities and investigate questionable features that may allow for unintended actions. |
  | `4. Exploitation` | Once we have found potential vulnerabilities, we prepare our exploit code, tools, and environment and test the webserver for these potential vulnerabilities. |
  | `5. Post-Exploitation` | Once we have successfully exploited the target, we jump into information gathering and examine the webserver from the inside. If we find sensitive information during this stage, we try to escalate our privileges (depending on the system and configurations). |
  | `6. Lateral Movement` | If other servers and hosts in the internal network are in scope, we then try to move through the network and access other hosts and servers using the information we have gathered. |
  | `7. Proof-of-Concept` | We create a proof-of-concept that proves that these vulnerabilities exist and potentially even automate the individual steps that trigger these vulnerabilities. |
  | `8. Post-Engagement` | Finally, the documentation is completed and presented to our client as a formal report deliverable. Afterward, we may hold a report walkthrough meeting to clarify anything about our testing or results and provide any needed support to personnel tasked with remediating our findings. |
