- Dig is a command-line tool used for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain information about domain names, IP addresses, and other DNS records. It is a #networking administration tool that is used for verifying and troubleshooting DNS problems and to perform DNS lookups. Dig command replaces older tools such as nslookup and the host. It is part of the BIND domain name server software suite and is available in major Linux distributions. Dig can operate based on command line option and flag arguments, or in batch mode by reading requests from an operating system file. When a specific name server is not specified in the command invocation, it uses the operating system's default resolver, usually configured in the file resolv.conf. Without any arguments, it queries the DNS root zone. Dig supports Internationalized domain name (IDN) queries. It can be used to query domain “A” record, remove comment lines, query domain “A” record with +short, query a specific DNS server, perform a reverse DNS lookup, query a specific DNS server and record type, query a specific DNS server and port number, query a specific DNS server and query type, query a specific DNS server and query class, perform a DNS lookup with a specific DNS server and EDNS0 options, and perform a DNS lookup with a specific DNS server and #tcp protocol.

- A #DNS zone transfer **port 53 zone transfer attack ** is a method of copying DNS-related databases across different DNS servers. It is a type of DNS transaction that allows two DNS servers to exchange their zones. This is needed for redundancy. DNS zone transfers using the AXFR protocol are the simplest mechanism to replicate DNS records across DNS servers[2]. Zone transfers can be initiated using the Dig command, which is a command-line tool used for querying the DNS. To initiate a zone transfer using Dig, you simply specify axfr (as the query type) and the domain name of the zone as arguments[3]. However, if DNS zone transfers are done using the AXFR protocol, there is no encryption and there is no authentication. Anyone can get the whole zone using the AXFR protocol. Malicious hackers may use the information contained in zones to conduct attacks[1][2].
