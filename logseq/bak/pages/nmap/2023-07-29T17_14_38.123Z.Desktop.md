- Nmap is a command-line tool used for #Networking exploration and security auditing. It is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Nmap is used by hackers, cybersecurity enthusiasts, network and system administrators, and penetration testers to find services, hosts, and open ports on a computer network. Nmap is used for the following purposes:
- Scan a range of IP addresses
- Port scanning
- Ping scan using Nmap
- Saving the Nmap scan output to a file
- Most popular ports scanning
- Display open ports
- Exclude host/IP addresses for the scan
- Service version detection
  
  Here are some example commands for Nmap:
- Scan a single target: ```nmap [target]```
- Perform a ping-only scan: ```nmap -sP [target]```
- Scan multiple targets: ```nmap [target1, target2, etc]```
- Display port state reason: ```nmap –reason```
- Attempt to guess an unknown OS: ```nmap -O –osscan guess [target]```
- Service version detection: ```nmap -sV [target]```
- Perform an RPC scan: ```nmap -sR [target]```
- Scan specific ports or scan entire port ranges on a local or remote server: ```nmap -p [port] [target]``` or ```nmap -p [port-range] [target]```
  
  Nmap is a powerful tool used for networking and security auditing of networks. It is helpful for quickly finding useful information about the networks, ports, hosts, and operating systems.
