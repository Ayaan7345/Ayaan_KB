- To use DirBuster in Kali Linux, you can follow these steps:
- 1. Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
  2. Type `dirbuster` in the terminal and press Enter. This will launch the DirBuster application.
  3. The DirBuster GUI will appear, allowing you to configure the settings for the directory and file brute force scan.
  4. In the "URL" field, enter the target website's URL, such as `http://example.com`.
  5. Choose the wordlist to use for the brute force scan. By default, DirBuster uses the `directory-list-2.3-small.txt` wordlist located at `/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt`.
  6. Select the options you want to use, such as whether to only use GET requests or to specify a file extension list.
  7. Click on the "Start" button to begin the brute force scan.
  8. DirBuster will start scanning the target website for directories and files, attempting to find hidden pages and applications.
  9. Once the scan is complete, DirBuster will display the results, showing the discovered directories and files.
- It's important to note that DirBuster is a powerful tool that should be used responsibly and with proper authorization. It is primarily used for web penetration testing and security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in web servers.
