	- What is NTLMv2
		- NTLMv2 (short for NT LAN Manager version 2) is a variation of the NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication protocol. It is the default authentication protocol used by Microsoft Windows and is a part of the Windows Security mechanism. NTLMv2 uses stronger encryption than the original NTLM and can help prevent the "pass the hash" attack and other similar techniques. GPT-b is a part of the NTLMv2 authentication protocol that provides stronger authentication for domain logons. When used, GPT-b provides the addition of server security checks that reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
