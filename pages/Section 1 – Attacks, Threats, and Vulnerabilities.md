			- Rainbow tables are a type of data structure used in cryptography to speed up the process of password cracking. They are essentially precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions. These tables are used to check the potential password hashes quickly. While they significantly reduce the time to crack a password, they also require substantial amounts of storage. Rainbow tables must be recomputed for each type of hash function and set of password constraints, which can be a time-consuming process.
