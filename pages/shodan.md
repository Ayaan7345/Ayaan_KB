- Shodan is a search engine that allows users to search for various types of servers and devices connected to the internet using a variety of filters. It is often described as a search engine of service banners, which are metadata that servers send back to clients. Shodan was launched in 2009 by computer programmer John Matherly, who conceived the idea of searching devices linked to the internet. The name "Shodan" is a reference to SHODAN, a character from the System Shock video game series[1].
- Here are some key points about Shodan:
- 1. Search Engine: Shodan is a search engine that focuses on finding devices connected to the internet, rather than websites like Google does[3][5].
  2. Device Discovery: It allows users to search for a wide range of devices, including webcams, routers, servers, power plants, mobile phones, refrigerators, and more[2].
  3. Service Banners: Shodan collects and indexes service banners, which provide information about the server software, supported options, welcome messages, and other details that can be obtained before interacting with the server[1].
  4. Scanning and Indexing: Shodan scans the internet by requesting connections to various IP addresses and indexing the information obtained from those connections. It uses a global #networking of computers and servers to crawl the web for devices[3][4].
  5. Filters and Search: Shodan offers search filters to help users quickly and efficiently search for specific devices or services. Users can search based on IP addresses, device names, cities, and other technical categories[3][6].
  6. Account and Restrictions: Shodan provides free accounts with limitations on the number of search results. Users can upgrade to paid accounts to access more features and remove restrictions[1][3].
  7. Security and Research: Shodan is used by cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and hackers to identify devices with vulnerabilities and gather information about the Internet of Things (IoT)[4][6].
- Overall, Shodan is a powerful search engine that provides insights into the devices and services connected to the internet. It can be a valuable tool for security research, #networking monitoring, and understanding the technology that powers the internet.
