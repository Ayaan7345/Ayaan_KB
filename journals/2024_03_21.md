- how to add timers to logseq tasks
	- To add timers to Logseq tasks, you will need to manually manage and track the timings, as Logseq currently does not support built-in timers or time tracking. Here are some steps to assist you:
	  
	  1. You can manually input the starting time you begin a task using `/now`. This command will input the exact current time. 
	  
	  2. When you finish the task, input `/now` again, which show you the ending time for your task.
	  
	  3. Calculate the difference between these two timestamps to measure how long you took for the task.
	  
	  Remember, this method is manual and doesn't involve any direct timer solution. However, it helps to have a sense of how long the task took, which can be useful for estimating the time for tasks in the future.
